  <p>This paper is about epistemic must and might. A sizeable proportion of the literature on epistemic modality takes as its point of departure data such as the following: (1) (In the context of direct observation of rain): a. # It must be raining outside. b. It is raining outside. Karttunen (1972) remarks that must φ is degraded when compared to bare unmodalized assertions of φ in ‘direct-observation’ contexts like (1). I’ll briefly address this ‘directness’ problem for the semantics of must, but my point of departure is a less-discussed issue. I’ll call it the ‘argumentation’ problem, discussed at length by Stone (1994) and illustrated by exchanges such as the following: (2) a. A: What’s the weather like outside? b. B: ? It must be raining. Stone remarks that in order for (2b) to be felicitous, Speaker A has to be able to identify the particular chain of reasoning that licenses the conclusion that it’s raining. If A cannot reconstruct B’s argument for rain, then (2b) is degraded. Like the directness problem, the argumentation problem has to do with an asymmetry in the felicity conditions of must φ and its bare counterpart. In (2), if B simply responds It’s raining, then B’s argument for rain need not be salient in context. A solution to the argumentation problem explains this asymmetry. I review two perspectives on the problem: the Semantic account, whereby the ‘argumentation’ property of must is encoded in the semantics of the modal; and the Pragmatic account, which posits that this property is contextually conditioned. Next, I present experimental evidence against the Pragmatic account. Finally, I present a solution to the argumentation problem and offer an account of must’s putative dual, might.</p>

  <p>Properties of the content of the clausal complement have long been assumed to distinguish factive predicates like 'know' from non-factive ones like 'think' (Kiparsky and Kiparsky 1970, i.a.). There is, however, disagreement about which properties define factive predicates as well as uncertainty about whether the content of the complement of particular predicates exhibit the properties attributed to the content of the complement of factive predicates. This has led to a lack of consensus about which predicates are factive, a troublesome situation given the central role that factivity plays in linguistic theorizing. This paper reports six experiments designed to investigate two critical properties of the content of the complement of clause-embedding predicates, namely projection and entailment, with the goal of establishing whether these properties identify a class of factive predicates. We find that factive predicates are more heterogeneous than previously assumed and that there is little empirical support from these experiments for the assumed categorical distinction between factive and non-factive predicates. We discuss implications of our results for formal analyses of presuppositions, one area where factivity has played a central role. We propose that projection is sensitive to more fine-grained meaning distinctions between clause-embedding predicates than factivity.</p>

  <p>Syntactic adaptation may be a key mechanism underlying children’s learning of novel words. Havron et al. (2019) exposed French-speaking children (ages 3 to 4) to a speaker biased toward using either familiar verbs or familiar nouns in a syntactic context which permitted both structures. This prime later influenced participants’ interpretations of ambiguous novel words presented in the same syntactic frame. In Experiment 1, we successfully replicated Havron et al. with 77 French-speaking adults, using a web-based eye-tracking paradigm. Experiment 2 adapted the paradigm to English, finding that repeated exposure to a syntactic structure induced 102 English-speaking adults to update their expectations about the meanings of novel words. Experiment 3 found similar evidence of syntactic adaptation in 74 three- to five-year-old English-speaking children. Participants adapted to the specific linguistic structure used, not just the speaker’s tendency to mention actions or objects.

  <p>While widely used in psycholinguistics, the linking hypothesis for eye movements in the visual world paradigm is still poorly understood. Recent work on linking hypotheses for referential tasks in particular has found mixed support for the Referential Belief Link: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the intended target in that time window. Here we test the hypothesis that participants’ expectations for the utterances observed in an experiment modulate the extent to which the Referential Belief Link holds. This hypothesis is motivated by a simple idea: when utterances are unexpected, listeners engage in additional reasoning to make sense of the observed signal. In a re-analysis of a previous eye movement and incremental decision task dataset, in conjunction with two novel production experiments, we find that the more surprising an observed utterance is, the smaller the correlation between explicit and implicit beliefs is. We discuss the importance of participants’ production expectations in research using the visual world paradigm.</p>

  <p>The ordering of morphemes in a word displays well-documented regularities across languages. Previous work has explained these in terms of notions such as semantic scope, relevance, and productivity. Here, we test a recently formulated processing theory of the ordering of linguistic units, the efficient tradeoff hypothesis (Hahn et al., 2021). The claim of the theory is that morpheme ordering can partly be explained by the optimization of a tradeoff between memory and surprisal. This claim has received initial empirical support from two languages. In this work, we test this idea more extensively using data from four additional agglutinative languages with significant amounts of morphology, and by considering nouns in addition to verbs. We find that the efficient tradeoff hypothesis predicts ordering in most cases with high accuracy, and accounts for cross-linguistic regularities in noun and verb inflection. Our work adds to a growing body of work suggesting that many ordering properties of language arise from a pressure for efficient language processing. </p>

  <p>Redundant modification in referring expression production varies both within language (e.g., English speakers produce more redundant color than size modifiers) and cross- linguistically (e.g., English speakers produce more redundant color modifoers than Spanish speakers). It is an open question whether these asymmetries are the result of asymmetries in the general referential utility of color and size modifiers or of incremental language processing pressures. Cross-linguistic investigations of redundant modification are important to this debate: similar cross-linguistic rates of redundant modification would suggest a strong role for general referential utility. In contrast, lower prevalence of redundant modification in languages with post-nominal modification suggests a strong role for incrementality. Here, we test whether differences in redundant adjective use are systematic for a particularly interesting language: Central Taurus Sign Language. As a language in its infancy, CTSL has no established conventions, and therefore provides us with a unique opportunity to explore how redundancy emerges in the initial stages of language formation. We evaluate different computational models of referring expression that each make different assumptions regarding the source of asymmetries in the production of redundant modifiers.</p>

  <p>A recent proposal of syntactic satiation claims that it is driven by adaptation: comprehenders track and update their beliefs about the probability of observing certain sentences, leading to subsequent increases in the acceptability of those sentences.

In two acceptability judgment experiments, we show that exposure to one type of island violation can lead to the satiation of another island type, suggesting that island type-general representations are tracked by comprehenders in addition to island type-specific representations.

  <p>Language and gender are inextricably linked; we regularly make reference to the genders of individuals around us, and the language used to do so recursively feeds the biases we hold about gender in the social world. What has been left under-investigated is the role that individual, rather than societally-held, ideologies about gender play in the linguistic system. In two web-based studies, we investigate the pro- cessing and production of gender-neutral role nouns such as congressperson as a function of individual gender ideology and political alignment. Our results indicate an asymmetry between the processing and production of such nouns: while individuals’ gender ideologies do not modulate processing, they do interact with political party in production tasks such that Democratic participants with more progressive gender ideologies produce more gender-neutral role nouns. We argue that these forms have become linguistic resources for indexing social progressiveness, leading to their use by Democrats and avoidance by Republicans.</p>

  <p>Experimental investigation is fundamental to theory-building in cognitive science, but its value depends on the linking as- sumptions made by researchers about the mapping between empirical measurements and theoretical constructs. We ar- gue that sufficient clarity and justification are often lacking for linking assumptions made in visual world eye-tracking, a widely used experimental method in psycholinguistic research. We test what we term the Referential Belief linking assump- tion: that the proportion of looks to a referent in a time window reflects participants’ degree of belief that the referent is the in- tended target in that time window. We do so by comparing eye-tracking data against explicit beliefs collected in an incre- mental decision task (Exp. 1), which replicates a scalar impli- cature processing study (Exp. 3 of Sun & Breheny, 2020). In Exp. 2, we replicate Sun and Breheny (2020) in a web-based eye-tracking paradigm using WebGazer.js. The results pro- vide support for the Referential Belief link and cautious opti- mism for the prospect of conducting web-based eye-tracking. We discuss limitations on both fronts.</p>

  <p>Memory limitations are known to constrain language comprehension and production, and have been argued to account for crosslinguistic word order regularities.
However, a systematic assessment of the role of memory limitations in language structure has proven elusive, in part because it is hard to extract precise large-scale quantitative generalizations about language from existing mechanistic models of memory use in sentence processing.
We provide an architecture-independent information-theoretic formalization of memory limitations which enables a simple calculation of the memory efficiency of languages.
Our notion of memory efficiency is based on the idea of a memory--surprisal tradeoff: a certain level of average surprisal per word can only be achieved at the cost of storing some amount of information about past context.
Based on this notion of memory usage, we advance the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis: the order of elements in natural language is under pressure to enable favorable memory-surprisal tradeoffs.
We derive that languages enable more efficient tradeoffs when they exhibit information locality: when predictive information about an element is concentrated in its recent past.
We provide empirical evidence from three test domains in support of the Efficient Tradeoff Hypothesis:
a reanalysis of a miniature artificial language learning experiment, a large-scale study of word order in corpora of 54 languages, and an analysis of morpheme order in two agglutinative languages. These results suggest that principles of order in natural language can be explained via highly generic cognitively motivated principles and lend support to efficiency-based models of the structure of human language.</p>

  <p>When referring to objects, speakers are often more specific than neces- sary for the purpose of establishing unique reference, e.g., by producing redundant modifiers. A computational model of referring expression production that accounts for many of the key patterns in redundant adjectival modification assumes that adjectives differ in how noisy (reliable), and consequently, how useful they are for reference. Here we investigate one hypothesis about the source of the assumed adjectival noise: that it reflects the perceptual difficulty of establishing whether the property denoted by the adjective holds of the contextually relevant objects. In Exp.1, we collect perceptual difficulty norms for items that vary in color and material. In Exp. 2, we test the highest (material) and lowest (color) perceptual dif- ficulty items in a reference game and find that material is indeed less likely to be mentioned redundantly, replicating previous work. In Exp. 3, we obtain norms for the tested items in a second perceptual difficulty measure with the aim of testing the effect of perceptual difficulty within property type. The overall results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that the propensity to redundantly use color over material adjectives may be driven by the relative ease of assessing an object’s color, compared to the relative difficulty of assessing its material.</p>

Our model makes incremental utterance choice predictions (Cohn-Gordon et al. 2018a; Cohn-Gordon et al. 2018b) and assumes a non-deterministic semantics for adjectives in referring expressions (Degen et al. 2020). The model captures previously attested production patterns in reference game experiments, including English speakers’ tendency to produce redundant color adjectives more frequently than redundant size adjectives, as well as Spanish speakers’ tendency to employ redundant color adjectives less frequently than English speakers.

Rational theories of language use have come under attack for decades for not being able to account for the seemingly irrational overinformativeness ubiquitous in referring expressions.

Constraint-based accounts, which seek to unify these conflicting results, make a prediction which we test here: the probability of an interpretation and the speed with which it is processed depends on the contextual support it receives. We manipulated contextual support for the scalar inference in two truth-value judgment experiments by manipulating a lexical feature (presence of partitive “of the”) and a pragmatic feature (the implicit Question Under Discussion). Participants’ responder type – whether their majority response was pragmatic (reflecting the inference) or literal (reflecting its absence) – was the main predictor of response times: pragmatic responses were faster than literal responses when generated by pragmatic responders; the reverse was true for literal responders.

In this work, we explore to what extent neural network sentence encoders can learn to predict the strength of scalar inferences. We first show that an LSTM-based sentence encoder trained on an English dataset of human inference strength ratings is able to predict ratings with high accuracy (r = 0.78).

  <p>Pragmatic theories of utterance interpretation share the assumption that listeners reason about alternative utterances that a speaker could have produced, but didn't. For such reasoning to be successful, listeners must have precise expectations about a speaker's production choices. This is at odds with the considerable variability across speakers that exists at all levels of linguistic representation. This tension can be reconciled by listeners adapting to the statistics of individual speakers. While linguistic adaptation is increasingly widely attested, semantic/pragmatic adaptation is underexplored. Moreover, what kind of representations listeners update during semantic/pragmatic adaptation – estimates of the speaker's lexicon, or estimates of the speaker's utterance preferences – remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate semantic/pragmatic adaptation in the domain of uncertainty expressions like might and probably. In a series of web-based experiments, we find 1) that listeners vary in their expectations about a generic speaker's use of uncertainty expressions; 2) that listeners rapidly update their expectations about the use of uncertainty expressions after brief exposure to a speaker with a specific usage of uncertainty expressions; and 3) that listeners' interpretations of uncertainty expressions change after being exposed to a specific speaker. We present a novel computational model of semantic/pragmatic adaptation based on Bayesian belief updating and show, through a series of model comparisons, that semantic/pragmatic adaptation is best captured by listeners updating their beliefs both about the speaker's lexicon and their utterance preferences.

  <p>Two contents of evaluative adjective sentences, like Kim was smart to watch the movie, are the prejacent (that Kim watched the movie) and the generalization (that the degree to which Kim watching the movie is smart was higher than the contextual standard of smart). The prejacent is standardly analyzed as a presupposition (e.g., Norrick 1978; Barker 2002; Oshima 2009; Kertz 2010). This paper argues against such analyses of the prejacent because, among other things, they do not capture an interaction between the prejacent and the generalization that has not yet been observed for projective content: when the prejacent projects, the generalization does not, and when the prejacent does not project, the generalization does. We develop an analysis according to which the prejacent is not a lexically specified presupposition but is projective to the extent that it is not at-issue with respect to the question addressed by the utterance of the evaluative adjective sentence. In addition to capturing the interaction between the prejacent and the generalization, our question-based projection analysis extends previous such analyses (e.g., Beaver & Clark 2008; Beaver et al. 2017; Simons et al. 2017) by incorporating a novel constraint on the question addressed by an utterance: the more the interpreter takes the truth of content c to follow from the common ground a priori, the less likely the question is about c. We provide experimental evidence for the analysis and argue that it improves on that of Karttunen et al. (2014), according to which evaluative adjectives are ambiguous.</p>

  <p>Processing language requires integrating information from multiple sources, including context, world knowledge, and the linguistic signal itself. How is this information integrated?

  <p>The past 15 years have seen increasing experimental investigations of core pragmatic questions in the ever more active and lively field of experimental pragmatics. Within experimental pragmatics, many of the core questions have relied on the operationalization of the theoretical notion of `implicature rate'. Implicature rate based results have informed the work on acquisition, online processing, and scalar diversity, inter alia. Implicature rate has typically been quantified as the proportion of `pragmatic' judgments in two-alternative forced choice truth value judgment tasks. Despite its theoretical importance, this linking hypothesis from implicature rate to behavioral responses has never been extensively tested. Here we show that two factors dramatically affect the `implicature rate' inferred from truth value judgment tasks: a) the number of responses provided to participants; and b) the linking hypothesis about what constitutes a `pragmatic' judgment. We argue that it is time for the field of experimental pragmatics to engage more seriously with its foundational assumptions about how theoretical notions map onto behaviorally measurable quantities, and present a sketch of an alternative linking hypothesis that derives behavior in truth value judgment tasks from probabilistic utterance expectations.</p>

  <p>Transmission of information by means of language is a potentially lossy process.

To investigate this issue, we present the results of a two- step iterated narration study: first, we collected a corpus of 250 crime story reproductions that were produced in parallel reproduction chains of 5 generations in depth, for 5 different seed stories; a second separate large-scale experiment then targeted readers’ interpretation of these reproductions. Crucially, strength of evidence for the guilt of each story’s suspect(s) was manipulated in the initial seed stories. Across generations, readers’ guilt perceptions decreased when the evidence was originally strong, but remained stable when evidence was originally weak.

  <p>Speakers exhibit variability in their choice between uncertainty expressions such as might and probably. Recent work has found that listeners cope with such variability by updating their expectations about how a specific speaker uses uncertainty expressions when interacting with a single speaker. However, it is still unclear to what extent listeners form speaker-specific expectations for multiple speakers and to what extent listeners are adapting to a situation independent of the speakers. Here, we take a first step towards answering these questions. In Experiment 1, listeners formed speaker-specific expectations after being exposed to two speakers whose use of uncertainty expressions differed. In Experiment 2, listeners who were exposed to two speakers with identical use of uncertainty expressions formed considerably stronger expectations than in Experiment 1. This suggests that listeners form both speaker-specific and situation-specific expectations. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of adaptation.</p>

  <p>A common dependent measure used in visual-world eye-tracking experiments is the proportion of looks to a visually depicted object in a certain time window after the onset of the critical stimulus. When interpreting such data, a common assumption is that looks to the object reflect the listener’s belief that the object is the intended target referent. While this is intuitively plausible (at least for paradigms in which the task requires selecting a referent), relatively little is known about how exactly the proportion of looks to an object is related to a listener’s current belief about that object. Here, we test a simple, explicit linking hypothesis: the proportion of looks to an object reflects the probability that the listener assigns to the object being the target. To test this hypothesis, we supplement the eye-tracking data from Leffel, Xiang, and Kennedy (2016) with an offline incremental decision task to measure participants’ beliefs about the intended referent at various points in the unfolding sentence, and assess the extent to which these beliefs predict the eye-tracking data. The results suggest that the degree to which an object is believed to be the referent is only one factor that affects eye movements in referential tasks. Preliminary free production data we have collected for the scenes suggests that utterance expectations also play a role.

  <p>Projective content is utterance content that a speaker may be taken to be committed to even when the expression associated with the content occurs embedded under an entailment-canceling operator (e.g., Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet, 1990). It has long been observed that projective content varies in how projective it is (e.g., Karttunen, 1971; Simons, 2001; Abusch, 2010), though preliminary experimental research has been able to confirm only some of the intuitions about projection variability (e.g., Smith & Hall, 2011; Xue & Onea, 2011). Given the sparse empirical evidence for projection variability, the first goal of this paper was to investigate projection variability for projective content associated with 19 expressions of American English. The second goal was to explore the hypothesis, called the Gradient Projection Principle, that content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue. The findings of two pairs of experiments provide robust empirical evidence for projection variability and for the Gradient Projection Principle. We show that many analyses of projection cannot account for the observed projection variability and discuss the implications of our finding that projective content varies in its at-issueness for an empirically adequate analysis of projection.</p>

      abstract = { Projective content is utterance content that a speaker may be taken to be committed to even when the expression associated with the content occurs embedded under an entailment-canceling operator (e.g., Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet, 1990). It has long been observed that projective content varies in how projective it is (e.g., Karttunen, 1971; Simons, 2001; Abusch, 2010), though preliminary experimental research has been able to confirm only some of the intuitions about projection variability (e.g., Smith & Hall, 2011; Xue & Onea, 2011). Given the sparse empirical evidence for projection variability, the first goal of this paper was to investigate projection variability for projective content associated with 19 expressions of American English. The second goal was to explore the hypothesis, called the Gradient Projection Principle, that content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue.

  <p>Nominal reference is very flexible—the same object may be called a dalmatian, a dog, or an animal when all are literally true. What accounts for the choices that speakers make in how they refer to objects? The addition of modifiers (e.g. big dog) has been extensively explored in the literature, but fewer studies have explored the choice of noun, including its level of abstraction. We collected freely produced referring expressions in a multi-player reference game experiment, where we manipulated the object’s context. We find that utterance choice is affected by the contextual informativeness of a description, its length and frequency, and the typicality of the object for that description.

We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants' expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure.

  <p>Three experiments investigated the processing of the implicature associated with some using a "gumball paradigm." On each trial, participants saw an image of a gumball machine with an upper chamber with 13 gumballs and an empty lower chamber. Gumballs then dropped to the lower chamber and participants evaluated statements, such as "You got some of the gumballs." Experiment 1 established that some is less natural for reference to small sets (1, 2, and 3 of the 13 gumballs) and unpartitioned sets (all 13 gumballs) compared to intermediate sets (6-8). Partitive some of was less natural than simple some when used with the unpartitioned set. In Experiment 2, including exact number descriptions lowered naturalness ratings for some with small sets but not for intermediate size sets and the unpartitioned set.

  <p>A rarely discussed but important issue in research on pragmatic inference is the choice of dependent measure for estimating the robustness of pragmatic inferences and their sensitivity to contextual manipulations. Here we present the results from three studies exploring the effect of contextual manipulations on scalar implicature. In all three studies we manipulate the salient question under discussion and the perceptual availability of relevant set sizes. The studies differ only in the dependent measure used: Exp. 1 uses truth judgements, Exp. 2 uses word probability ratings, and Exp. 3 uses a direct measure of sentence interpretation. We argue that the first two are effectively measures of production, and find they are sensitive to our contextual manipulations. In contrast the interpretation measure shows no effect of context.

  <p>In the face of underspecified utterances, listeners routinely and without much apparent effort make the right kinds of pragmatic inferences about a speaker's intended meaning. This dissertation investigates the processing of scalar impli- catures as a way of addressing how listeners perform this remarkable feat. In particular, the role of context in the processing of scalar implicatures from some to not all is explored. Contrary to the widely held assumption that scalar impli- catures are highly regularized, frequent, and relatively context-independent, this dissertation suggests that they are in fact relatively infrequent and highly context- dependent; both the robustness and the speed with which scalar implicatures from some to not all are computed are modulated by the probabilistic support that the implicature receives from multiple contextual cues. Scalar implicatures are found to be especially sensitive to the naturalness or expectedness of both scalar and non-scalar alternative utterances the speaker could have produced, but didn't. A novel contextualist account of scalar implicature processing that has roots in both constraint-based and information-theoretic accounts of language processing is proposed that provides a unifying explanation for a) the varying robustness of scalar implicatures across different contexts, b) the varying speed of scalar implica- tures across different contexts, and c) the speed and efficiency of communication.</p>

      abstract = { In the face of underspecified utterances, listeners routinely and without much apparent effort make the right kinds of pragmatic inferences about a speaker's intended meaning. This dissertation investigates the processing of scalar impli- catures as a way of addressing how listeners perform this remarkable feat. In particular, the role of context in the processing of scalar implicatures from some to not all is explored. Contrary to the widely held assumption that scalar impli- catures are highly regularized, frequent, and relatively context-independent, this dissertation suggests that they are in fact relatively infrequent and highly context- dependent; both the robustness and the speed with which scalar implicatures from some to not all are computed are modulated by the probabilistic support that the implicature receives from multiple contextual cues. Scalar implicatures are found to be especially sensitive to the naturalness or expectedness of both scalar and non-scalar alternative utterances the speaker could have produced, but didn't. A novel contextualist account of scalar implicature processing that has roots in both constraint-based and information-theoretic accounts of language processing is proposed that provides a unifying explanation for a) the varying robustness of scalar implicatures across different contexts, b) the varying speed of scalar implica- tures across different contexts, and c) the speed and efficiency of communication. }

  <p>People’s representations of most and arguably all linguistic and non-linguistic categories are probabilistic. However, in lin- guistic theory, quantifier meanings have traditionally been de- fined set-theoretically in terms of categorical evaluation func- tions. In 4 “adaptation” experiments, we provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis that quantifiers are represented as probability distributions over scales (e.g., Zadeh, 1965). We manipulate exposure to different distributions of “some” and “many” and find that listeners adapt to those distributions, as predicted. Our results suggest that the interpretation of quanti- fiers is best modeled as a process involving rich, probabilistic representations.</p>
